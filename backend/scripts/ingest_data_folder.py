A systematic approach to pain assessment is fundamental to effective pain management:

1. Initial Pain Assessment:
   - Location: Use body diagrams to map pain distribution
   - Intensity: 0-10 numerical rating scale, visual analog scale
   - Quality: Sharp, dull, burning, aching, cramping, stabbing
   - Temporal patterns: Constant, intermittent, episodic
   - Onset and duration: Acute (<3 months) vs chronic (>3 months)

2. Functional Impact Assessment:
   - Activities of daily living limitations
   - Sleep disturbances and patterns
   - Work and social functioning
   - Mobility and physical limitations
   - Psychological impact (mood, anxiety, depression)

3. Pain History and Context:
   - Previous pain episodes and treatments
   - Family history of chronic pain conditions
   - Current medications and their effectiveness
   - Allergies and contraindications
   - Substance use history

4. Physical Examination:
   - Inspection for obvious deformities or asymmetry
   - Palpation for tenderness, swelling, warmth
   - Range of motion testing
   - Neurological assessment when indicated
   - Provocative tests for specific conditions

5. Psychosocial Assessment:
   - Pain catastrophizing and coping strategies
   - Social support systems
   - Work and financial stress
   - Mental health screening
   - Cultural and spiritual considerations

        "content": """
Evidence-based multimodal approach to pain management integrates multiple therapeutic modalities:

1. Pharmacological Management:
   Non-opioid first-line therapies:
   - Acetaminophen: 325-1000mg every 4-6 hours (max 4g/day)
   - NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 400-800mg every 6-8 hours with food
   - Topical agents: Capsaicin, menthol, salicylates
   
   Adjuvant medications for neuropathic pain:
   - Gabapentin: Start 100-300mg TID, titrate to effect
   - Pregabalin: Start 75mg BID, increase as tolerated
   - TCAs: Amitriptyline 10-25mg at bedtime, increase gradually

2. Non-Pharmacological Interventions:
   Physical modalities:
   - Heat therapy: 15-20 minutes, 104-113¬∞F for muscle pain
   - Cold therapy: 10-15 minutes for acute inflammation
   - TENS units: 20-30 minutes, 2-4 times daily
   - Massage therapy: Swedish, deep tissue, myofascial release

   Exercise therapy:
   - Aerobic conditioning: 150 minutes moderate intensity/week
   - Resistance training: 2-3 sessions/week, major muscle groups
   - Flexibility and stretching: Daily, hold stretches 15-30 seconds
   - Aquatic therapy: Reduced joint loading, improved mobility

3. Psychological Interventions:
   - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): 8-12 sessions
   - Mindfulness-based stress reduction: 8-week programs
   - Relaxation techniques: Progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing
   - Biofeedback training: EMG or thermal feedback for muscle tension

4. Interventional Procedures:
   - Joint injections: Corticosteroids for inflammatory conditions
   - Nerve blocks: Diagnostic and therapeutic applications
   - Radiofrequency ablation: For facet joint pain
   - Spinal cord stimulation: For failed back surgery syndrome

Augmented Reality applications in pain management and patient education:

1. Pain Visualization and Education:
   - 3D anatomical models for patient education
   - Interactive pain mapping on virtual body models
   - Real-time visualization of affected structures
   - Treatment mechanism demonstrations (injections, procedures)

2. Therapeutic Applications:
   - Guided meditation and relaxation exercises
   - Virtual reality distraction during procedures
   - Gamified physical therapy exercises
   - Posture correction with real-time feedback

3. Assessment and Monitoring:
   - Motion tracking for functional assessment
   - Gait analysis using smartphone cameras
   - Range of motion measurement tools
   - Pain diary integration with visual elements

4. Clinical Training and Education:
   - Simulation of pain conditions for healthcare providers
   - Procedural training in virtual environments
   - Patient case studies with interactive elements
   - Continuing education modules with AR components

5. Implementation Considerations:
   - Device compatibility and accessibility
   - Patient privacy and data security
   - Integration with electronic health records
   - Cost-effectiveness and reimbursement
   - Clinical validation and evidence requirements
