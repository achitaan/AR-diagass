Acute pain management involves immediate assessment and treatment of pain 
lasting less than 3 months. Key principles include:

1. Pain Assessment:
   - Use validated pain scales (0-10 numeric rating)
   - Assess pain location, quality, and timing
   - Consider functional impact

2. Multimodal Approach:
   - Combine pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods
   - Consider acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opioids when appropriate
   - Integrate physical therapy and relaxation techniques

3. Safety Considerations:
   - Monitor for contraindications
   - Assess risk of dependency
   - Regular reassessment and adjustment

Chronic pain (>3 months duration) requires comprehensive, 
interdisciplinary management:

1. Comprehensive Assessment:
   - Biopsychosocial evaluation
   - Functional assessment tools
   - Comorbidity screening

2. Treatment Modalities:
   - Physical therapy and exercise
   - Cognitive behavioral therapy
   - Medication management (non-opioid preferred)
   - Interventional procedures when indicated

3. Self-Management:
   - Patient education
   - Coping strategies
   - Activity pacing

AR technology can enhance pain education and management:

1. Visualization Benefits:
   - 3D anatomy visualization for pain education
   - Interactive exercise demonstrations
   - Real-time feedback for proper form

2. Patient Engagement:
   - Gamification of therapy exercises
   - Progress tracking and motivation
   - Distraction during procedures

3. Clinical Applications:
   - Pre-procedure education
   - Rehabilitation guidance
   - Self-management skill building
