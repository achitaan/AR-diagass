# TensorFlow Body-Pix Module Resolution Fix

## Problem Diagnosis ✅

The error was caused by a missing dependency in the project:

```
"Unable to resolve module @tensorflow-models/body-pix from C:\Users\SSGSS\Documents\AR-diagass\mobile\hooks\useBodySegmentation.ts"
```

## Root Cause

The `useBodySegmentation.ts` hook was importing `@tensorflow-models/body-pix` but this package was not installed in the project dependencies.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Installed Missing Package**
```bash
npm install @tensorflow-models/body-pix
```

### 2. **Fixed Import Issues**
Updated `useBodySegmentation.ts`:
- Changed `import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'` to `import { CameraView } from 'expo-camera'`
- Removed duplicate `TensorCamera` export to avoid conflicts with `useRealPoseDetection.ts`

### 3. **Verified Installation**
- ✅ @tensorflow/tfjs v4.22.0
- ✅ @tensorflow-models/pose-detection
- ✅ @tensorflow-models/body-pix (newly installed)
- ✅ @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native

## Files Modified

1. **package.json** - Added `@tensorflow-models/body-pix` dependency
2. **hooks/useBodySegmentation.ts** - Fixed imports and removed duplicate exports
3. **Created verification scripts** - To test all imports work correctly

## Testing Results

- ✅ All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ All required TensorFlow packages can be imported
- ✅ No module resolution conflicts
- ✅ Ready for React Native development server

## Next Steps

The app should now start without the body-pix module resolution error. The body segmentation functionality is ready to be used alongside pose detection for enhanced AR features.

## Prevention

For future development, always ensure that:
1. All imported packages are listed in `package.json` dependencies
2. Imports use the correct component names (e.g., `CameraView` vs `Camera`)
3. Avoid duplicate exports between different hooks/modules
